# powerball_checker
Checks Powerball winnings.

###Usage

The Powerball checker script can be used to check a list of Powerball tickets (in CSV format) against a set of numbers drawn in the lottery.

The format of the CSV file is as follows:

|Ticket Number | WB 1 | WB 2 | WB 3 | WB 4 | WB 5 | Powerball|
|------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---------|
|12345-6789 | 32 | 16 | 19 | 57 | 34 | 13|

To run the script, just run powerball_checker.py and type `start` on the command prompt.
